1. What is Sablotron?
========================================

Sablotron is an XML processor fully implemented in C++. It uses Expat by
James Clark as an XML parser. Sablotron implements XSLT 1.0, XPath 1.0 
and DOM Level2.

Original creator of Sablotron is Ginger Alliance (www.gingerall.com).

Sablotron is an Open Source project released under the MPL (Mozilla Public 
License). Alternatively you may use Sablotron under the GNU's GPL license.

Please, look at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL or
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html for further info.

If you want use the debugger, you may optionally ask Sablotron to use

3. Warranty

4. Porting
========================================

So far Sablotron is tested on Linux (RedHat 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, and 7.0), 
Windows (NT 4.0, 95, 98, 2000), Solaris (2.5.1, 2.6, 7), HP-UX (11.00), 
FreeBSD (3.4, 4.1), OpenBSD (2.8 beta) and OpenServer (5.0.x). We hope, 
that it should work on most other Unix systems as well.

If you build Sablotron on some other system, please, let us
know. All porting activities are welcome.
