License Restrictions

The files are protected by copyright and no unauthorized use is 
permitted.

You may use the files on commercial and personal web servers, and with 
analytic/statistics software, without violating my copyright.

You shall not offer the files for redistribution without prior 
authorization.

You shall not mirror the files without prior authorization.

If you intend to make use of the files in conjunction with a 
commercial product or service that contains an auto-update feature you 
shall contact me first to obtain permission.

Said permission is usually perfunctory. Mostly I'm concerned with 
things like what the added load on my server might be. If the 
potential load is too large I might ask you to mirror the files on one 
of your servers and have your customers update via your mirror.

If you want to disregard my request and launch your product without 
consulting me please plan on your customers losing access to their 
updates fairly quickly. In short, it's a lot easier to be polite about 
this and contact me first. That way I can work with you to ensure 
you'll get the services you'll need without the risk and embarrassment 
of being cut-off from receiving updates.

All other license restrictions remain as-is.
